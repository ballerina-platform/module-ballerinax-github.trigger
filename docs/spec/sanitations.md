# Sanitation for AsyncAPI specification

This document records the sanitation done on top of the AsyncAPI specification for the GitHub trigger (`asyncapi.yml`, this directory). Unlike a client connector, this package is a webhook *trigger* (an inbound listener) generated from an AsyncAPI spec, not an OpenAPI client spec — the spec describes the webhook events GitHub delivers, not a REST API this package calls out to. These changes are done in order to improve the overall usability, and as workarounds for some known language limitations.

1. Marked the `assignee` field on `PullRequestPayload` and the `starred_at` field on `StarPayload` as explicitly nilable (`?` on the type) in the generated Ballerina records, matching the `nullable: true` declared on both in the spec - the generator otherwise produced non-nilable required fields, which fails to deserialize a real payload where either value is `null`.
2. Reordered the `GenericDataType` union so that schemas with no required fields (e.g. `Installation`) are grouped after every concrete event type, instead of wherever they happened to fall in declaration order. Ballerina resolves union-typed JSON conversion by trying members in declaration order; a schema with every field optional can structurally match almost any payload, so leaving one ahead of a more specific event type risks it being matched first.
3. Quoted the `off` and `null` enum values in `asyncapi.yml` (`pull_request_reviews_enforcement_level` and `security_severity_level`) - unquoted, YAML 1.1 parses bare `off`/`null` as the boolean `false`/the null literal rather than the intended string values.
4. Filled in ~44 previously-blank (`type: object` with no properties) webhook payload fields, tracked in `ballerina-platform/ballerina-library#9120`. Each shape was checked against real GitHub data rather than guessed from field or event names - primarily [octokit/webhooks](https://github.com/octokit/webhooks) (community-maintained real example payloads and JSON schemas) and [github/docs](https://github.com/github/docs) (GitHub's own docs-source repository, which renders the official webhook-events-and-payloads pages and proved more current than octokit/webhooks for a few newer fields). A handful of fields remain deliberately blank where the real-world shape is still too thin or inconsistent across both sources to be confident about - see issue #9120 for the current list.

## Ballerina trigger generation

The Ballerina trigger source (`listener.bal`, `dispatcher_service.bal`, `service_types.bal`, `types.bal`) is generated from `asyncapi.yml` using the `asyncapi-tools` generator (`ballerina-platform/asyncapi-tools`). The command should be executed from the repository root directory.

```bash
bal asyncapi http -i docs/spec/asyncapi.yml -o ballerina/
```

This overwrites `listener.bal`, `dispatcher_service.bal`, `service_types.bal`, and the data-types file in `ballerina/` with fresh output. Diff the result before committing - anything currently correct only because of a hand patch to these files (rather than to the spec or the generator itself) will be silently reverted by this command.

Note: the generated license header year is derived at generation time, not hardcoded - it will match whatever year the tool is run in.
